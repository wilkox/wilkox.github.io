# Is a comorbid anxiety disorder a poor prognostic factor in a patient with severe depression (major depressive disorder)?

---
class: middle

**Population**: Patients with severe depression and a comorbid anxiety disorder

**Intervention**: Standard treatment, either as inpatient or outpatient, depending on severity of disease

**Comparator**: Patients with severe depression but no comorbid anxiety disorder

**Outcome**: Severity of symptoms

This is a **prognosis** question. The best evidence for this question would be a **cohort study** or **case-control study**.

# Cohort

- 1346 MDD patients (DSM IV-TR criteria) recruited from 10 sites across 8 European countries between 2011–2016
  - Treated with at least 1 antidepressant drug for at least 4 weeks
- Exclusion criteria:
  - Any other **primary** psychiatric disorder
  - Any substance disorder in previous 6 months
  - Any severe personality disorder

---

# Data collection

- All patients interviewed by consultant psychiatrist
- Socio-demographic, clinical, treatment, and pharmacological information obtained in interview
- Presence of a comorbid anxiety disorder assessed by consultant psychiatrist with standardised Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)
- Symptom severity at present and at onset of current episode assessed with Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)

---

# Statistical methods

- Patients divided into two groups depending on presence or absence of comorbid anxiety disorder of any type
- Between-group comparisons (χ², ANCOVA) performed on a range of descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations or percentages) for 37 variables for all anxiety disorders, then again for each anxiety disorder subgroup (generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia)
- Total of 185 statistical tests, no correction for multiple comparisons

---

# Results: prevalance

- Overall prevalance of comorbid anxiety disorder of any kind in MDD 21.2%

# Strengths of study

- Large, multi-centre study
- Standardised data collection and evaluation methods (use of standardised inventories)
- Measured variables are relevent to both patients and clinicians (suicide risk, symptom severity, treatment efficacy)

---

# Weaknesses of study

- No correction for multiple comparisons
- Single time point

---

# Unanswered questions

- Would like to see more detailed breakdown of symptoms by category
- How are longer-term outcomes (duration of symptoms, duration of episodes, suicide risk, mortality, symptom progression, recurrance) affected?
