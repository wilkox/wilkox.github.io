# Electromyography and nerve conduction studies

> The sensory responses in the upper and lower limbs are all robust and well within normal limits. Lower limb motor responses are small and distal motor latencies are moderately prolonged, though the feet are cool. There is mild slowing of motor conduction velocity in the right common peroneal nerve. Both tibial F wave responses are within normal latency for her height, though the right was less persistent than expected (30%) and some A waves were seen. **The motor responses in the upper limbs were very small and this was out of keeping with the power on physical examination. This was repeated multiple times with no technical cause identified. The motor response amplitude dramatically increased (> 300%) after 10 seconds of exercise. The phenomenon was observed in both the median-aPB and ulnar-ADM studies.**

# Pathophysiology of LEMS

- Autoantibodies directed against pre-synaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs)
  - Ten subtypes of VGCCs in humans, defined by α<sub>1</sub> subunit
  - P/Q type (named for Purkinje neurones and cerebellar granule cells) comprise >95% of VGCCs at NMJ and are major autoantibody target in LEMS
  - Autoantibody activity against P/Q type VGCCs in the cerebellum may explain ataxia/loss of coordination
- SCLC cell lines have been shown to express P/Q type VGCCs (as well as many other components of the NMJ including ACh receptor subunits)<sup>1</sup>
- Non-paraneoplastic LEMS is poorly understood, however is associated with other autoimmune conditions including T1DM and immune-mediated thyroid disease

# Epidemiology

- Estimates of point prevalence range from 2.3/million (region of the Netherlands<sup>1</sup>) to 2.6/million (US military veteran population<sup>2</sup>)
- Typically diagnosed in middle age (58 ± 14<sup>1</sup>)
- May be somewhat more prevalent in males
- At least 50% of LEMS cases are associated with malignancy
- Approximately 3% of SCLC patients will develop LEMS (n = 63)<sup>3</sup>

# Clinical features

- Progressive proximal muscle weakness
  - Lower limbs > upper limbs
  - Often associated with myalgia
  - Functional decline > loss of power
  - Marked reduction or absence of deep tendon reflexes
  - Paraneoplastic form typically has more rapid progression with more widespread weakness
  - Can progress to diaphragmatic involvement and respiratory failure
- Post-exercise recovery in power and deep tendon reflexes
- Autonomic dysfunction
  - Dry mouth and erectile dysfunction most common reported symptoms; constipation, diarrhoea, postural symptoms, dry eyes, and changes to sweating have also been reported<sup>1</sup>
  - Pupils may be sluggish

---

# Clinical features

- Cranial nerve symptoms less common
 - Typically bulbar symptoms
 - Ocular signs (ptosis, diplopia) much rarer than in MG

---

# Diagnosis

- EMG/NCS
  - Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) e.g. 20 Hz for 10 seconds → increase in CMAP > 100% ('postactivation facilitation')
  - Latency and velocity are typically normal
- P/Q type VGCC autoantibody radioimmunoassay
  - 85–95% sensitivity however low specificity; present at varying levels in other conditions including malignancies, paraneoplastic syndromes and MG

---

# Treatment

- Indication for treatment is based on functional impairment; watch and wait may be appropriate for patients with mild symptoms
- Diagnosis and treatment of malignancy is crucial

## Medications

- Amifampridine
  - Presynaptic potassium channel blockade
  - Prolongs presynaptic depolarisation → increased calcium entry
  - Mild adverse effects (headache, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea), can cause seizures at high doses
- Pyridostigmine
  - Of limited benefit
- Guanadine
  - Narrow therapeutic window - nephrotoxicity, bone marrow suppression
- In absence of malignancy, or in treated malignancy: IVIG, prednisolone + azathioprine, rituximab, plasmapheresis

---

# Prognosis

- In paraneoplastic LEMS, malignancy is usually life-limiting factor
  - SCLC typically diagnosed in patients with LEMS ten years earlier than those without<sup>1</sup>
  - Patients with SCLC and LEMS typically have significantly longer survival than patients without (24 months, 95% CI 7–41 vs 7 months, 95% CI 5–9, n = 148<sup>2</sup>)
- Life expectancy in non-paraneoplastic LEMS is unchanged
